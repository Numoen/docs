# Numoen Registry

While the underlying protocol, Numoen Core can permissionlessly support any asset token. Our web application only supports CELO for the time being. We will expand our offering and add to our registry as we continue to improve the user experience and expand to new EVM chains.

## How to your token added on the public registry?

In the public discord, please make a ticket and title it "Numoen Registry," with the token that you would like to be added.&#x20;
