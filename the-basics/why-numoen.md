# Why Numoen?

In the last few years, Automated Market Makers (AMMs) have become the dominant mechanism for decentralized exchange on the blockchain. Yet, this exchange design has been limited to spot asset trading. The nature of the algorithm that powers many of the most widely adopted AMMs, x\*y=k  inadequately prices derivative instruments. On top of that, liquidity providers in existing constant product AMMs suffer losses on their LP positions when markets are volatile.  Even furthering the demand for proper hedging which derivatives are designed to offer.

As such, Numoen Core is an automated market making protocol designed to  offer traders the perpetual options exposure on any asset for the first time in DeFi. Options which are widely used in traditional finance offer the most dynamic hedging strategies and even simplified leverage exposure.&#x20;

Expanding on the power perpetual design "Squeeth," invented by Paradigm. Anyone can mint or burn a long or short perpetual option on any asset. What that means is your gains and losses are squared when you hold a Numoen Option. The concavity offers the potential hedge on the impermanent loss seen in a Uniswap LP position.&#x20;

Ultimately, we see AMMs being an operating system for the next evolution of finance. One that is completely on-chain and autonomous. With no oracle dependencies, no custody over user funds, and no privileged access to the codebase, we feel we have created derivatives exchange and liquidity provisioning protocol that mirrors the values of permissionlessness core to Ethereum.&#x20;
